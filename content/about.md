# Hello There, I'm yuya

## About Me
I’m yuya, a 28-year-old software engineer currently living in Japan. I’m passionate about crafting reliable and efficient software solutions. In my free time, I love exploring the outdoors through mountaineering, honing my skills in Mahjong, going for runs to clear my mind, and occasionally hitting the golf course.

## Tech Stack
My work involves a wide range of technologies:
- **Python**: My go-to programming language for backend development, automation, and scripting.
- **Docker**: Used for containerization and ensuring consistent, reproducible environments.
- **Nuxt**: Front-end framework for creating performant and scalable web applications.
- **PostgreSQL** & **SQLite**: Preferred databases for handling both large-scale and lightweight data storage needs.
- **Bash** & **Ansible**: For managing servers, configuring environments, and automating DevOps tasks.
- **Flask**: A lightweight yet powerful microframework for building quick and efficient web backends.

## Hobbies
When I’m not working, you can find me:
- **Mountaineering**: Conquering new peaks and enjoying the solitude of nature.
- **Mahjong**: Engaging in strategic gameplay and friendly competitions.
- **Running**: Pushing my limits, improving my stamina, and staying healthy.
- **Golf**: Enjoying leisurely games that challenge both precision and patience.
